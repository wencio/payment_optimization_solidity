# PaymentManager Smart Contract

## Overview

The `PaymentManager` contract is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to manage and execute payments once certain conditions are met. It aims to optimize gas usage by structuring payments efficiently, reducing unnecessary gas consumption during transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity version ^0.8.0
- An Ethereum wallet or development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

## Features

1. **Ownership**: The contract is owned by a specific address.
2. **Threshold and Deadline**: Payments are executed when the total deposited funds reach a specified threshold and after a certain deadline.
3. **Payment Struct**: Stores details of each payment, including recipient, amount, and execution status.
4. **Gas Optimization**: The contract is designed to optimize gas usage, ensuring efficient execution of payment transactions.

## Contract Structure

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PaymentManager {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public threshold;
    uint256 public deadline;
    uint256 public totalDeposits;

    struct Payment {
        address recipient;
        uint256 amount;
        bool executed;
    }
}
```

### Variables

- `owner`: The address of the contract owner.
- `threshold`: The amount of funds required to trigger payment execution.
- `deadline`: The timestamp after which payments can be executed.
- `totalDeposits`: The total amount of funds deposited into the contract.

### Structs

- `Payment`: Contains the recipient's address, the amount to be paid, and a flag indicating whether the payment has been executed.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `PaymentManager` contract using an Ethereum wallet or development tool.
2. **Deposit Funds**: Send funds to the contract address to increase `totalDeposits`.
3. **Execute Payments**: Payments can be executed when `totalDeposits` reaches `threshold` and `deadline` has passed, ensuring efficient gas usage during these transactions.
